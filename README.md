# Multi-Drone Gesture Control
### Augusta University Drone Research
This project aims to extend an <a href="https://github.com/kinivi/tello-gesture-control" target="_blank">existing gesture drone control project</a> to multiple drones to form a comprehensive machine-learning/neural network solution to swarm control. This project is led by a team of researchers working for the Augusta University School of Computer and Cyber Sciences.

This project has also been used in forming an academic research paper on the performance comparison of different activation functions in neural network
training for cyber-physical system applications.
